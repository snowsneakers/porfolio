#Portfolio
This will take everyone back to the good old days, the 90s. I wanted to create something using the pokeapi.co API, so I made a game to test your Pokemon knowledge. Chose your favorite generation, start guessing Pokemon, and get a high score!

This is my fully responsive portfolio, also known as, the side project that is never complete.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:

I have learned that my portfolio will never be perfect, but it can display so much about me and my work.
